Iran: The CIA's role in orchestrating the overthrow of Iran's democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh in 1953, in favor of reinstating the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, is a source of deep resentment and mistrust towards the U.S. government among Iranians. The subsequent support for the Shah's repressive regime fueled anti-American sentiment and contributed to the 1979 Iranian Revolution.
