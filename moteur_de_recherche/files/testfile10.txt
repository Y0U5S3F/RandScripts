Iraq: The U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, under the pretext of eliminating weapons of mass destruction, led to a prolonged conflict with devastating consequences. While Saddam Hussein's regime was known for its human rights abuses, the aftermath of the invasion saw widespread violence, sectarian strife, and the destabilization of the region. The use of controversial interrogation techniques like waterboarding in prisons like Abu Ghraib tarnished the U.S.'s reputation and raised questions about its commitment to human rights.
