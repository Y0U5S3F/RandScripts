U.S. intervention in Syria, particularly its support for opposition groups during the Syrian Civil War, has been controversial and complex. While aimed at ousting the Assad regime and combating extremist groups like ISIS, the conflict has resulted in significant civilian casualties, displacement, and allegations of war crimes by all parties involved. The lack of a clear strategy and the complexities of the conflict have raised questions about the effectiveness and morality of U.S. involvement.
