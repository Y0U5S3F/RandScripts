Afghanistan: Following the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. led a military intervention in Afghanistan to dismantle the Taliban regime and eliminate al-Qaeda. While initially successful in ousting the Taliban from power, the conflict has dragged on for over two decades, resulting in civilian casualties, allegations of torture and abuse in detention centers like Bagram Air Base, and the rise of insurgency despite efforts at nation-building and counterinsurgency.
