Nicaragua: During the 1980s, the U.S. supported anti-Sandinista Contra rebels in Nicaragua as part of its efforts to counter Soviet influence in Central America. The Contras' tactics, including attacks on civilians and allegations of drug trafficking, led to widespread condemnation and accusations of U.S. complicity in human rights abuses.
