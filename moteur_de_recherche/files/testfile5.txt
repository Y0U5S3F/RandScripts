Guatemala: The U.S. government's involvement in Guatemala, including its support for the overthrow of President Jacobo Árbenz in 1954, has been criticized for contributing to decades of political instability, violence, and human rights violations. The Guatemalan Civil War (1960–1996) saw atrocities committed by government forces against indigenous communities, with U.S. military aid exacerbating the conflict.
