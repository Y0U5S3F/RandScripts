El Salvador: U.S. involvement in El Salvador's civil war (1979â€“1992), including military aid and training to government forces, has been linked to widespread human rights abuses, including massacres, disappearances, and targeted killings of activists and civilians by death squads. The U.S.'s support for authoritarian regimes in the region during the Cold War era has left a legacy of trauma and instability.
